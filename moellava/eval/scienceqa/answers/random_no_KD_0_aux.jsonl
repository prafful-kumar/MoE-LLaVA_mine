{"question_id": "5", "prompt": "<image>\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Gordon's test show?\nA. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.", "text": "B", "answer_id": "bvj7xK7FYsgLWGXCTLBWaZ", "model_id": "MoE-LLaVA-StableLM-Stage2-moe", "metadata": {}}

{"question_id": "6371", "prompt": "<image>\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nErnest was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Ernest put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Ernest's test show?\nA. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nC. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.", "text": "B", "answer_id": "mFLJf7gv93VKjZq2RSgsxd", "model_id": "MoE-LLaVA-StableLM-Stage2-moe", "metadata": {}}

{"question_id": "8296", "prompt": "<image>\nContext: Read the text.\nA conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past.

{"question_id": "8732", "prompt": "<image>\nContext: Read the text about cats.\nCats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!\nBased on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago?\nA. The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses.\nB. The cats hunted and brought food to the farmers.\nC. The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice.\nD.

{"question_id": "16126", "prompt": "<image>\nContext: Read the text about bats.\nSeveral kinds of animals \"talk\" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nBased on the text, how are fruit bats different from most other animals?\nA. They can communicate with many kinds of animals.\nB. They can communicate about specific problems.\nC. They can understand some human speech.\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.", "text": "A", "answer_id": "8ytKGK9JYXHcahdkA355mq", "model_id": "MoE-LLaVA-StableLM-Stage2-moe", "metadata": {}}

She wondered how much bacteria might be growing in her cup of tea as the morning went on.\nTo find out, Valentina filled three identical cups with tea and placed them on her desk for three hours. After the first hour, she placed a drop of the tea from each cup on a separate microscope slide and counted the number of bacteria in the drop. Valentina repeated this with each cup of tea after the second hour, and again after the third hour.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure.\nFigure: using a microscope to count bacteria on a slide.\nWhich of the following was a dependent variable in this experiment?\nA. the number of bacteria in a drop of tea\nB. the amount of time that the tea sat on the desk\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.", "text": "A", "answer_id": "nitQGxccN4NzuqgFDb85uW", "model_id": "MoE-LLaVA-StableLM-Stage2-moe", "metadata": {}}

Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nKeratins are strong proteins that provide structure and protection for many tissues in the human body. For example, the tissue on the inside of the mouth, called epithelium (ep-i-THEEL-i-um), is protected by a tough layer made of many types of keratin proteins connected together. One type of keratin protein is encoded by the KRT13 gene.\nA certain person had a mutation in the KRT13 gene. Compared to the KRT13 gene without a mutation, the mutated KRT13 gene encoded a form of the keratin protein with a different structure.\nThis different form of the keratin protein could not connect to other keratin proteins.The person with the mutation had mouth epithelium that was easily damaged by simple activities like eating and brushing teeth.\nFigure: strands of connected keratin proteins, seen through a high-powered microscope.\nComplete the sentence.\nThe mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().\nA.
